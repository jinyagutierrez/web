      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm 19 years old turning 20 this April 3rd. I was born in Indonesia and grew up abroad. I went to Indonesia, China, Hongkong, Vietnam, Singapore, California, San Francisco, and Las Vegas. Spending time outside the Philippines feels so different especially the culture shock that I have experienced. It was nice that I got to expose to different parts of the globe and explore places, things, people. Another interesting fact about me is I love taking pictures of myself and it makes me more confident. Confidence is the key when doing something because that will make you be successful. My skills are, I can provide service for others such as a helping hand, I also have attention to details and flexibility such as management skills.</p>

              <p class="card-text text-justify">I have been growing my account since 2020. Initially, I kept it low-profile, but eventually, I started posting casually and sharing pictures of myself and doing fits. I enjoy doing this as it boosts my self-esteem and provides entertainment throughout the day. Those who have seen me on TikTok also follow me here on Instagram, admiring my content. Additionally, I have developed photography skills and know how to capture flattering angles, which I consider as part of my skill set.</p>

              <p class="card-text text-justify">Ever since I was a kid, I have been doing origami and other crafts and artworks during my leisure time. Now, I have created ribbon roses, crochet tulips, and paper flowers. Whenever I have spare time, I engage in crafting, and sometimes I give my creations as gifts. This skill has been one of my strengths as I've grown because I can utilize it for present and future purposes. My goal for the year 2024 is to practice new skill with painting and the use of oil pastel to broad my crafting or art skills since I can see that I have potential with regards to this specific aspect and improve it as well as another idea for me to focus. I can start with small and basic paintings then gradually large.</p>

              <p class="card-text text-justify">Last year, I started to explore cooking different recipe especially the time when I'm on vacation. This enhanced my ability to use my time management and measure the ingredients such as the quanities. The picture that is attached are the sample foods that I have cooked such as tofu katsu curry, enoki beef rolls with kimchi fried rice, chicken pastil, sushi bake, chicken teriyaki with enoki.  I have been planning to learn how to bake and that is my next goal after gaining knowledge with cooking. If I would bake I can sell them and gain some profit which will help benefit me. Baking cookies would be the easiest to start with then next would be cake.</p>
